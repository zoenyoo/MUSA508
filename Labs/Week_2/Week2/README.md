# MUSA_508_Lab2

The goal of MUSA_508_Lab2 is to:

* Learn the basics of working with GitHub

* Gain knowledge on how the `{sf}` package works and what a CRS is

* Practice knitting a markdown, committing, and pushing to your GitHub repo

You will accomplish this by:

* Get yourself a [GitHub account](https:\\www.github.com)

* Install `Git` onto your computer

* If you like, install GitHub Desktop onto your computer. RStudio is the only tool youâ€™ll need to work with GitHub, but your choice.
* `Fork` this GitHub repository to your GitHub account
* Use RStudio to create a version controlled project from YOUR repo (which is a copy of this)
* Once you have the files on your computer (aka `cloned` the repo), start working with the `MUSA_508_LAb2_sf.Rmd` file to learn about the `{sf}` package.
* Read `MUSA_508_LAb2_sf.Rmd`, run the code line by line and make sure you understand the content. Ask questions on Piazza. Make sure you can `knit` the entire document without error.
* After that, open the `Lab2_assignment.Rmd`.
* This assignment is a small sample of the code from the exercise, but there are areas or code removed where you need to add your own input. 90% of the code is there, but you will need to fill in the blanks to make it run.
* Once the code runs without error, `knit` that to a markdown, `commit` all of your changes, and `push` it to your GitHub repo. There are more detailed instructions within that file. 

Setting up GitHub can be a breeze or it can be frustrating. There are a number of links and slide from my GitHub Intro in the `Resources` page of Piazza. There is a wealth of info on the web as well, but use the Piazza Q&A, because others will likely have the same questions.

Best of luck!!!
